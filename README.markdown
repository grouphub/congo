Congo
=====

GroupHub front-end. Allows brokers to help group admins and employees manage
their benefit plans.

Getting started
---------------

1.  Make sure you have Git installed and the proper Github keys set up.
2.  Make sure you have a recent version of Ruby installed with the bundler gem.
3.  In order to run the tests, you will need Firefox installed. Visit
    https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/, download Firefox, copy it to
    your Applications folder, and run it once to make sure it's setup properly.
4.  Make sure you have Postgres installed. Run `brew install postgresql` and
    follow the instructions.
5.  Make sure you have Redis installed. Run `brew install redis` and follow the
    instructions.
6.  You will need ngrok in order to test enrollment locally. Visit
    <a href="http://ngrok.com">http://ngrok.com</a> and sign up. Under your
    Dashboard, make note of your "auth token". Then, in the Terminal,
    `brew install ngrok`, and run `ngrok -authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`. Hit
    `ctrl-c` to quit.
7.  Clone the repo. `git clone https://github.com/grouphub/congo.git`.
8.  `cd congo`
9.  `bundle`
10. Verify the settings in `config/database.yml` look correct.
11. Run `script/bootstrap`.
12. Run `script/ngrok` if you would like to receive callbacks from PokitDok.
13. You can run the tests via `bundle exec rspec spec`.
14. Run the server using `script/start`.
15. Visit the site locally at
    <a href="http://localhost:5000">http://localhost:5000</a>.

Debugging
---------

### Debugging Ruby code

1. Somewhere in your Ruby code, place a `binding.remote_pry` statement on its
   own line.
2. Trigger that section of code.
3. From your Terminal, run `pry-remote`. You will get a Ruby console whose
   context is the block containing your `binding.remote_pry` call.
4. To exit, type `exit` and hit Enter.

### Debugging JavaScript

1. Open your developer console (in Firefox or Chrome, it is `command-shift-i`).
2. In your JavaScript code, place a `debugger` statement on its own line.
3. Refresh the page.
4. Trigger that section of code.
5. The window will go grey, and your console will be open to your line of code.
6. To exit the debugger, click the icon that looks like a vertical bar followed
   by a "play" triangle.

Generate an ERD Diagram
-----------------------

    brew install graphviz
    bundle exec rake diagram:all
    open doc/models_complete.svg

You can find the generated SVG files in `doc/**/*.svg`.

Deployment
----------

### Deploying to Heroku

1. Login to [http://heroku.com](http://heroku.com) and make sure that your SSH
   keys are setup properly. Also make sure that you have access to "grouphub
   staging" project.
2. Install the Heroku toolbelt and run `heroku login` to log in from the
   Terminal.
3. Merge your code into master.
4. `git push heroku master`

### Deploying to Elastic Beanstalk

1. `brew install aws-elasticbeanstalk`
2. Follow instructions
   [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3.html) to
   get setup.
3. Merge your code into master.
4. `eb congo`

Setting up Servers
------------------

### Basic Setup

In order to SSH into servers, you will need to get the "grouphub-congo" keypair
from Roger. Then you can shell in like so:

    KEY=~/.ssh/grouphub-congo
    HOST=ec2-52-1-31-195.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    ssh -i $KEY ec2-user@$HOST

You will need to set the following environment variables in your `~/.bashrc` or
similar. You can get these keys from Roger.

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='...'
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='...'

### Front-ends

Then you will need to install the Elastic Beanstalk tools.

    brew install aws-elasticbeanstalk

To get setup, you will need to run the following:

    eb setup
    eb use congo-staging

You can deploy like so:

    eb deploy

To deploy to production:

    eb use congo-production
    eb deploy

Front ends are auto-scaled by Elastic Beanstalk and should not need to be
provisioned manually. I will put more documentation here eventually.

To SSH into a front-end box:

    # On your machine
    eb ssh

    # Once SSH'ed in
    cd /var/app/current
    bundle

    # Run the Rails console
    bundle exec rails console

    # Run the Postgres console
    PGPASSWORD=$RDS_PASSWORD bundle exec rails dbconsole

    # Tail the logs
    tail -n 50 -f log/production.log

    # To sweep the database, first log into the AWS console, reboot RDS, then
    script/bootstrap

### Workers

#### Provisioning a New Server

Setup an EC2 instance using the control panel or the CLI tool. Use an "Amazon
Linux" 64-bit AMI.

Make sure you can shell into the server. For example:

    KEY=~/.ssh/grouphub-congo
    HOST=ec2-52-1-31-195.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    ssh -i $KEY ec2-user@$HOST

Prepare the server. Make sure you're ssh'ed in, and run:

    # Install packages as root
    sudo su
    yum update --assumeyes
    yum install --assumeyes \
      gcc-c++ patch readline readline-devel zlib zlib-devel \
      libyaml-devel libffi-devel openssl-devel make \
      bzip2 autoconf automake libtool bison iconv-devel \
      git tmux postgresql-libs postgresql-devel

    curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup | bash -
    yum install --assumeyes nodejs
    exit

    # Consider running the following commands in `tmux`...

    # Install rbenv, ruby, and bundler as ec2-user
    git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
    source ~/.bashrc
    rbenv install 2.2.0
    rbenv global 2.2.0
    mv ~/bin ~/bin.old
    gem install bundler
    rbenv rehash

Test that everything is correct:

    which ruby # ~/.rbenv/shims/ruby
    which bundle # ~/.rbenv/shims/bundle
    bundle -v # Bundler version 1.9.1

Set the environment variables. Make sure you're SSH'ed in, fill in the following
lines with your variables, then run:

    echo '' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo '# Environment variables' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export RACK_ENV="production"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export SECRET_TOKEN="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export SECRET_KEY_BASE="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export AWS_SECRET_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export AWS_REGION="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export RDS_HOSTNAME="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export RDS_PORT="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export RDS_DB_NAME="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export RDS_USERNAME="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export RDS_PASSWORD="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export S3_BUCKET="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export SQS_DEFAULT_QUEUE="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export SQS_MAILERS_QUEUE="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export REDIS_URL="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export CONGO_CLOCK_SECONDS=300' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export CONGO_CLOCK_LOG=log/clock.log' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export CONGO_CLOCK_PID=tmp/pids/clock.pid' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export POKITDOK_CLIENT_ID="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export POKITDOK_CLIENT_SECRET="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export POKITDOK_CALLBACK_HOST="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export SENDGRID_USERNAME="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export SENDGRID_PASSWORD="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PAPERTRAIL_HOST="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PAPERTRAIL_PORT="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PAPERTRAIL_PROGRAM="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export NEWRELIC_LICENSE_KEY="..."' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export NEWRELIC_APP_NAME="..."' >> ~/.bashrc

Make sure you have SQS, Postgres on RDS, and Redis on Elasticache setup and
permissioned properly.

Test that everything is correct:

    cat ~/.bashrc
    env

In the Congo project on your local machine, edit "config/workers.rb" so that the
"boxes" list also contains your new server's info.

Then try deploying:

    WORKER_NAME=congo-staging-worker-1 bundle exec rake workers:deploy

#### Tasks

At any time you can get a full list of rake tasks:

    # Show all rake tasks with descriptions
    bundle exec rake -T

    # Show all rake tasks
    bundle exec rake -vT

    # Show all worker-related tasks
    bundle exec rake -T | grep workers

To get a list of servers:

    bundle exec rake workers:info

To deploy all:

    # Deploy all
    bundle exec rake workers:deploy

    # Deploy one
    WORKER_NAME=congo-staging-worker-1 bundle exec rake workers:deploy

To stop or start the workers and clocks:

    # Stop all
    bundle exec rake workers:stop

    # Stop one
    WORKER_NAME=congo-staging-worker-1 bundle exec rake workers:stop

    # Start all
    bundle exec rake workers:start

    # Start one
    WORKER_NAME=congo-staging-worker-1 bundle exec rake workers:start

`bundle exec rake workers:start` and `bundle exec rake workers:restart` are
synonyms. Both of them will try and stop the workers before starting them again.
